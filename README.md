# Injury Prediction in American Football

In the field of data science, a solid understanding of both the business and the data is crucial. This allows us to apply our judgment and enhance the model or make valuable observations. For this exercise, I have chosen to conduct logistic regression based on American football. Personally, it's not my favorite sport to watch, but having played it for 10 years before coming to Spain, I am well aware of the significant injury problem it faces.

## Objective

Develop a model capable of predicting the risk of injuries using various variables such as field type (synthetic or natural), position on the field, or type of play.

## Conclusions

The model did not achieve optimal results, showing signs of overfitting. However, I am sharing this project because, despite not reaching the desired outcomes, it demonstrates various methods to address overfitting issues, along with data cleaning and standardization.

### Dataset

This exercise is based on the Kaggle dataset: "NFL 1st and Future - Analytics."
